# Multiple-Intersection-Traffic-Simulation
A RL-based framework employing a Dueling Deep Q Network (2DQN) to minimize
waiting times at five intersections, enhancing overall traffic efficiency.
Executed a priority system for emergency vehicles within the framework, guaranteeing their
expedited and secure movement to prioritize public safety.
